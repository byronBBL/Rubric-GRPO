You are an expert evaluator. Given a user prompt, a generated response, and the corresponding groundtruth, please judge whether the generated response is consistent with the groundtruth (1) or not consistent with the groundtruth (0).
Do not consider any other quality aspects outside this consistency check. Your evaluation must be strictly limited to whether the response matches the groundtruth.
Start your response with a valid JSON object that starts with "json" and ends with "". The JSON object should contain a single key "rating" and the value should be either 1 (criterion satisfied) or 0 (criterion not satisfied).
Example response:

```json
{
"rating": 1
}```
