You are an expert rubric writer for a wide range of academic disciplines (e.g., Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics). Your job is to generate a self-contained set of evaluation criteria (“rubrics”) for judging how good a response is to a given question in one of these disciplines. Rubrics may cover aspects such as factual correctness, reasoning/process, completeness, and computational accuracy. Each rubric item must be fully self-contained so that a non-expert reader can easily and unambiguously decide whether the criterion is satisfied.

Inputs:
* question: The full question text.
* reference_answer: The ideal (model) answer, including any key facts, explanations and reasoning steps.
* groundtruth: The correct final fact(s) or result(s) for the question.

High-level rules:
- Total items: Generate between 3 and 10 rubric items, choosing the number appropriate to the complexity of the question and prioritizing the most important evaluation aspects for the discipline and task.
- Categories: Use exactly two category types and these exact category-prefix strings at the start of every `description`:
  - `Factual Criteria:` — for verifiable final facts or answers.
  - `Process Criteria:` — for key intermediate steps, calculations, theorems, or reasoning required to derive the final answer.
- When to generate each category:
  - Factual Criteria: Generate **only when** the question has one or more determinable, verifiable final facts/answers (e.g., a definite numeric result, a specific choice among options, or a factual statement).  
    • If the question has multiple independent final facts or parts, generate a separate Factual Criteria for each.  
    • Rule of interpretation: the response is considered factually correct only if **all** Factual Criteria are satisfied.  
  - Process Criteria: Generate for the **necessary** intermediate results, explicit sub-answers, key equations, definitions, or theorems that must be invoked. Each Process Criteria must be concrete and testable, e.g., “States that the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x)” or “Shows substitution u = x² in the integral.” Avoid vague wording like “uses proper reasoning” — instead specify the exact reasoning element or intermediate result required.

Mutual exclusivity:
- Every rubric item must evaluate a distinct, non-overlapping aspect of the answer. Do not duplicate coverage across items.

Item format rules:
Each rubric item must be an object with exactly two keys: `description`, `weight`.
1.  description: Exactly one sentence beginning with the category prefix (`Factual Criteria:` or `Process Criteria:`) followed by a clear, testable statement of what to look for.
    • If the question involves multiple-choice answers, explicitly reference them by label, e.g., “Identifies (A)”.  
    • If the final answer must be explicitly stated, include a Factual Criteria checking for that statement.  
    • If intermediate reasoning must be shown, include Process Criteria that require the exact steps (specific intermediate results, explicit formulas, or named theorems).  
2.  weight: Numeric importance. For both Factual Criteria and Process Criteria use integers from **1 to 5** (5 = most important). Assign weights to reflect relative importance among the generated items.


Category examples:
- Factual Criteria (verifiable final fact):
  • Example (Math): `Factual Criteria: States the correct final value of the integral as π/2.` (weight 5)  
  • Example (Biology): `Factual Criteria: Identifies mitochondria as the site of ATP production in eukaryotic cells.` (weight 5)  
- Process Criteria (explicit intermediate step):
  • Example (Math): `Process Criteria: Shows the substitution u = x² and adjusts the limits accordingly before integrating.` (weight 4)  
  • Example (Physics): `Process Criteria: Applies Newton’s second law F = ma to set up the differential equation for motion.` (weight 5)

Additional requirements:
- All rubric items must be easy to evaluate as satisfied/not satisfied.  
- Avoid vague criteria such as “demonstrates understanding” or “explains clearly.” Always specify the exact required fact, intermediate step, or theorem.  
- Output: Return ONLY the JSON array of rubric objects. Each object must contain exactly the two keys `description`, and `weight`, and nothing else. The `description` must begin with one of the two exact category prefixes.  
- Tone: Precise, unambiguous, and testable — each description must define a binary-style check.

Now, given the question, reference_answer and groundtruth, generate the rubric as described. The reference answer is an ideal response but may not be fully correct or exhaustive; use it only as a helpful guide.
