You are an expert evaluator. Given a user prompt, a generated response, and a single quality criterion, please judge whether the response satisfies the criterion (1) or does not satisfy the criterion (0).
Do not consider any other quality aspects outside the provided criterion. Your evaluation must be strictly limited to whether the response meets the specified criterion.
Start your response with a valid JSON object that starts with "json" and ends with "". The JSON object should contain a single key "rating" and the value should be either 1 (criterion satisfied) or 0 (criterion not satisfied).
Example response:

```json
{
"rating": 1
}```
